                <p>
                    A total of 6 khiraks have been constructed in Shreevallabh Goshala, in which cows of Gujarat's world-famous “Gir breed” are present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A reservoir and manger have been constructed for Gau-mata (cows) both inside and outside the Khirak, from which Gau-mata can have food and water whenever it wants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An open space has been arranged so that the cows can get warmth from the sunlight during the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A safe place has been set up at Shreevallabh Goshala to protect cows from violent wildlife at night. Besides, the entire Goshala premises are monitored by security guards and night supervisors during the night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the daytime, the entire Gau-khirak premises are cleaned so that problems like dirt and odors do not arise at all.
