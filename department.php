                    <p>
                        A reservoir and manger have been constructed for Gau-mata (cows) both inside and outside the Khirak, from which Gau-mata can have food and water whenever it wants.

                    <p>
                        An open space has been arranged so that the cows can get warmth from the sunlight during the day.
